# Experiment - Paginated Dataset in Canvas App / Custom Page

This repo includes an experiment to implement Paginated Dataset support via Power FX.

The solution includes a Plugin, a Custom API, Custom Connector and a Canvas App to demonstrate the experiment.

Limitations:
- There is no support for filtering the dataset in the current implementation. This could be support but needs to be added.
